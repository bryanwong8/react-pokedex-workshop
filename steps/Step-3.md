# Step 3 - Components

At this point we have the basics of what we want for our app. The only steps left are to call an API to get data and display it through. However, in it's currently structure, as more features are added, maintaining it will become very challenging. This is because all the functionality is in the one App component. For such a small app, having everything in one place has been convenient, but it'll scale poorly.

## ü•á Goal

The goal of this step is to practice creating and composing React components. Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen, etc. In React apps, all of these are commonly expressed as components.

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

## üé¨ Concepts

- Creating and composing React components
- Configuring components via passing props

## üìö Tasks

## PokeCard

Let's start by creaing a new folder in `src` called `components`. Afterwards create the file `src/components/PokeCard.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const PokeCard = () => {
  return null;
};

export default PokeCard;
```

Next, move over the card UI into the component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Button, Card, Col, Space } from 'antd';
import {
  getBackgroundType,
  getType
} from 'helper/pokemonHelpers';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const PokeCard = () => {
  return (
    <Col span={6}>
      <StyledCard typeName={getBackgroundType('grass')}>
        <Space align='start'>
          <div>
            <StyledTitle>Bulbasaur</StyledTitle>
            <StyledButton
              typeName={getType('grass')}
              width='100'
              shape='round'
              size='small'
            >
              Grass
            </StyledButton>
            <StyledButton
              typeName={getType('poison')}
              width='100'
              shape='round'
              size='small'
            >
              Poison
            </StyledButton>
          </div>
          <img alt='' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/1.png" />
        </Space>
      </StyledCard>
    </Col>
  );
};

export default PokeCard;
```

`NOTE: Move the StyledCard, StyledTitle, StyledButton to PokeCard.js as well.`

Back in `src/App.js`, we'll import `PokeCard` at the top of the file:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Row } from 'antd';
import PokeCard from 'components/PokeCard';
import styled from 'styled-components';
```

In place of where the PokeCard display code used to be, we'll render <PokeCard />.

```javascript
return (
  <StyledContainer className='site-card-wrapper'>
    <Row>
      <PokeCard />
    </Row>
  </StyledContainer>
);
```

## PokeType

Since we will be reusing the Pokemon's type, lets also create a component for that too.

Lets start by making a `src/components/PokeType.js` file with:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';

const PokeType = () => {
  return null;
};

export default PokeType;
```

Next copy over the types components from `src/components/PokeCard.js` into PokeType:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'antd';
import { getType } from 'helper/pokemonHelpers';
import { uppercaseWord } from 'helper/shared';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const StyledButton = styled(Button)`
  background-color: ${props => props.typeName};
  color: white;
  border: none;
  width: ${props => props.width}%;
  margin-right: 5px;
  margin-top: 5px;
`;

const PokeType = () => {
  return (
    <StyledButton
      typeName={getType('grass')}
      width='100'
      shape='round'
      size='small'
    >
      Grass
    </StyledButton>
  );
};

export default PokeType;
```

Right now the PokeType will always be grass, so lets make it more dynamic with props. Props are just values that can be passed into other components:

```javascript
const PokeType = props => {
  return (
    <StyledButton
      typeName={getType(props.type)}
      width={props.width}
      shape='round'
      size='small'
    >
      {props.type}
    </StyledButton>
  );
};
```

Finally all we have to do in the `PokeCard`, is to import `PokeType` and pass in the correct props:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Button, Card, Col, Space } from 'antd';
import { getBackgroundType } from 'helper/pokemonHelpers';
import PokeType from 'components/PokeType';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const PokeCard = () => {
  return (
    <Col span={6}>
      <StyledCard typeName={getBackgroundType('grass')}>
        <Space align='start'>
          <div>
            <StyledTitle>Bulbasaur</StyledTitle>
            <PokeType type='grass' width='100' />
            <PokeType type='poison' width='100' />
          </div>
          <img alt='' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/1.png" />
        </Space>
      </StyledCard>
    </Col>
  );
};

export default PokeCard;
```
